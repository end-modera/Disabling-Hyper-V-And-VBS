## ⚠️ THE REBOOT PROCESS (DO NOT SKIP)
Once your computer restarts, it will boot into a firmware-level screen (usually blue or black text). **You must perform these actions manually:**

### STEP 1: Disable Feature
When prompted on the screen, press the **[ F3 ]** key. 
*(This confirms you want to disable Device Guard/Credential Guard).*

### STEP 2: Confirm and Boot
Immediately after pressing F3, you will be asked to confirm one last time.
Press **[ ANY KEY ]** (Spacebar, Enter, etc.) to finish the process and boot into Windows.

| Step | Action | Key |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Confirm Disable** | `F3` |
| **2** | **Continue to Windows** | `Any Key` |

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
* **Script closes immediately:** Ensure the PowerShell script is named exactly `DG_Readiness_Tool_v3.6.ps1`.
* **"File not found":** Ensure you unzipped the files. Do not run the script from inside a `.zip` archive.
* **No F3 prompt:** If your PC boots directly to Windows without showing a blue/black screen, the tool did not trigger correctly. Ensure you ran the `.bat` as Administrator.
